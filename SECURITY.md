# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates only for actively maintained versions of our platform. Since GemDistrict.art is a live web application with continuous deployment, we support only the current production version.

| Deployment Status       | Supported |
|-------------------------|-----------|
| Current production (`main` branch) | ✅ Yes    |
| Any older commit or tag | ❌ No     |

> 💡 Note: Smart contracts are immutable once deployed. We only deploy audited contracts, and critical risks are mitigated via user alerts or migration paths.
